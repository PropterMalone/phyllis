# Phyllis — Claude Code Usage Optimizer

> Scheduler that puts deferrable Claude Code work into empty usage windows, with awareness of promos and peak hours.

Last verified: 2026-03-30

## Problem

Anthropic subscription plans have three rate-limit windows:
- **Session window**: ~5 hours, **rolling** from first message after previous window expires
- **Weekly all-models**: reset time is **dynamic and moves around** — do NOT hardcode a day/time. Read it live from `sevenDayResetAt` / `seven_day.resets_at` (`getHoursUntilWeeklyReset` does this). Observed ~Monday 11pm the week of 2026-05-30. (Was wrongly documented as "Friday 3:00 PM" — corrected 2026-05-30.)
- **Weekly Sonnet-only**: also dynamic; previously observed ~Tuesday 6:00 PM but treat as variable.

Heavy sessions (NineAngel runs, 3CB resolution, JeffWolf A/B batteries) can exhaust a window, blocking interactive work. Meanwhile, overnight and off-peak windows go unused.

### Rate limit nuances
- **Peak-hour reduction** (new March 2026): 5am-11am PT weekdays get reduced session limits; off-peak gets more headroom
- **Output tokens cost ~5x input** on the API — likely weighted similarly for subscription quota (output-heavy sessions like subagent batteries burn faster)
- **No API for remaining quota** on subscription plans — multiple GitHub issues requesting it, all closed. Deliberately opaque.
- **`/status`** command in Claude Code may show remaining allocation (needs testing)
- **Usage shared** across claude.ai and Claude Code — same pool

## Design

### Existing tools (don't rebuild)

- **`ccusage`** (`npx ccusage@latest`) — Community tool. Parses `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`, shows token usage by day/week/month. Has a statusline mode (`bun x ccusage statusline`). Active project (800+ issues).
- Community tools: `claude-code-limit-tracker`, `Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor`

### Phyllis's unique value: scheduling + awareness

1. **Statusline integration** — Feed window state into `~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`. Show "Window: ~35% used, resets in 4h12m" in every session. Uses ccusage data.

2. **Post-session accounting** — Hook or wrap-time summary: "This session used ~X tokens (Y% of your current window)." Calibrates intuition.

3. **Task queue** — Deferrable tasks with t-shirt size estimates (S/M/L/XL). Human tags the size. Flat JSON file. Prime candidates:
   - 3CB round resolution (~16 deck-plan agents + crosscheck + tiebreakers, weekly)
   - JeffWolf A/B battery (17+ sets × 2 modes)
   - NineAngel whole-project runs
   - Mediabot episode pipelines
   - Rolosync batch imports

4. **Scheduler** — Cron that checks window state and drains the queue via `claude -p` when headroom exists. Prefers:
   - Promo off-peak windows (free against weekly budget)
   - Regular off-peak hours (more headroom allocated)
   - Fresh windows with no recent interactive activity

5. **Promo awareness** — Config flag or scrape for active promotions. When active, aggressively schedule deferrable work into off-peak windows (that usage is free against weekly limits).

6. **Burn point detection** — Calculate whether remaining weekly budget exceeds what can physically be consumed in the remaining windows before weekly reset. Formula: `burn_point = remaining_weekly_budget > (hours_until_weekly_reset / 5) * per_window_cap`. Once at the burn point, all scheduling constraints drop — fire everything immediately since you can't exhaust the weekly budget even running flat out. This is the key signal for "stop deferring, start spending." Requires empirical calibration of the weekly budget (not published by Anthropic — back into it from `total_tokens_this_week / weekly_pct_used` using the desktop app's % readout).

### Deterministic step extraction

Any step that can run deterministically (formatting, linting, file copying, git operations) should run outside the LLM, not burn tokens. This applies both to Phyllis's own scheduling and as a general design principle for pipelines it schedules. When queuing a task, identify which sub-steps are mechanical and run those via plain bash, reserving `claude -p` for the parts that actually need the model. (h/t @zvxg.bsky.social)

### What we skip

- Token estimation engine — human tags tasks with t-shirt sizes
- Rebuilding ccusage — use it as a dependency
- Extra usage ($) cost optimization — billing concern, not scheduling
- Scraping the desktop app usage pane — no programmatic access, use for manual calibration only

### Data sources

- **ccusage** — primary token accounting
- **Session JSONL files**: `~/.claude/projects/-home-user-Projects-*//*.jsonl` — each assistant message has `usage` object. **Must walk `subagents/` subdirs too** or heavy sessions get massively undercounted.
- **history.jsonl**: `~/.claude/history.jsonl` — user messages with project path and session ID
- **Desktop app usage pane**: Manual calibration reference (% used + reset times)

### Promos

Anthropic runs periodic promotions (e.g., March 2026: 2x usage during off-peak hours, March 13-28). Key properties:
- Off-peak defined as outside 8am-2pm ET weekdays
- Promo usage **doesn't count toward weekly limits** — separate pool
- Applied automatically across Claude web, desktop, Code, Excel, PowerPoint
- Affects Free/Pro/Max/Team (not Enterprise)

### Key unknowns

- Exact weighting of input vs output vs cache tokens for subscription rate limiting
- Whether extra usage ($) consumption counts against the subscription window or is separate
- Exact token budget per window per plan tier (deliberately not published)
- How promos are announced — no API; support articles + UI changes are the signals
- Whether `/status` command gives usable remaining-quota data

### Window capacity variance

Windows may not be uniform. Known sources of variance:
- **Peak-hour reduction** (March 2026): 5am-11am PT weekdays reportedly get reduced session caps, off-peak gets more. Not yet empirically validated.
- **Promos**: Can double off-peak capacity (March 2026 promo did this).
- **Unknown**: Whether weekend windows differ from weekday, whether model choice affects window size differently than token count suggests.

Burn point math must account for heterogeneous windows: sum of remaining individual window capacities, not `count * uniform_cap`.

### Calibration (Phase 0 — active now)

Before scheduling, we need empirical data on actual window capacities. Capture these data points per window:

| Field | Source |
|-------|--------|
| `window_start` | First message timestamp from JSONL |
| `window_end` | `window_start + 5h` |
| `tokens_consumed` | ccusage blocks data |
| `throttled` | Boolean — did you hit the cap? |
| `throttle_timestamp` | When throttling started (if applicable) |
| `peak_hour` | Boolean — was window start during 5am-11am PT weekdays? |
| `promo_active` | Boolean — was a promo running? |
| `weekly_pct_before` | Weekly % used from desktop app (screenshot at window start) |
| `weekly_pct_after` | Weekly % used from desktop app (screenshot at window end/throttle) |
| `model_mix` | Which models used (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku split) |

Store in `calibration-log.jsonl`. Capture opportunistically — screenshot the usage pane when starting and ending heavy sessions, note whether you got throttled. A few weeks of data points will reveal whether windows are uniform and what the actual budgets are.

### Window chaining strategy

Windows are rolling — starts on first message after previous expires. Dead gaps between windows waste both capacity and calibration opportunities. Strategy: chain windows by firing the next deferrable task as soon as the previous window expires. Every window produces a data point, every gap gets used.

Don't open windows with pings — open them with real work. The queue should always have something deferrable in it. Cron detects window expiry, fires next queued task, new window opens with productive work.

Timing consideration: don't open a window 5 hours before you need interactive use. If you'll sit down at 8am, a window opened at 3am expires at 8am — forcing you to open a new one immediately. Better: fire deferrable work at 3am (window 3am-8am), let it expire, then your 8am interactive session gets a fresh full window.

Key calibration targets:
- **Weekly budget estimate**: `total_tokens / weekly_pct_used` (need 3-5 data points)
- **Per-window cap**: tokens at throttle point (need to actually hit a cap)
- **Peak vs off-peak ratio**: compare same-model sessions at different times

## Build order

0. **Calibration data collection** — DONE. Harvester auto-collects from ccusage. 96+ data points.
1. **Statusline** — DONE. Block cost + time remaining in statusline.
2. **Post-session hook** — DONE. `SessionEnd` hook runs `phyllis snapshot` automatically.
3. **Historical heatmap** — DONE. Day×hour heatmap + project breakdown + weekly summary.
4. **Queue + scheduler** — DONE. Task queue with t-shirt sizes, scheduler with peak/interactive-hour awareness, runner via `claude -p`.
